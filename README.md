# ava

ava is a simple avatar server written in TypeScript for Node with SvelteKit and OIDC support.
This exists for a few reasons:
1. I wanted to learn SvelteKit
2. I wanted to try implementing OAuth2/OIDC
3. Authentik doesn't have built-in handling for profile pictures
    - ...and I don't wish to use hacky shit with attributes...
    - ...I hate Gravatar...
    - ...and in my opinion, Libravatar/ivatar is fucking ugly
